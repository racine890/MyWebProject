	This is a sample project made only with js. It has no use, just designed to explain the course.

	To use it with file protocol, just launch the app/pages/menu.html
	To run it fully, start a server typing "python3 httpServerExample.py" and then access your browser at
	http://localhost:3000 to see how it works.

	The whole server part is due to localstorage domain protection, as it sees every file or directory 
	as a different domain.
